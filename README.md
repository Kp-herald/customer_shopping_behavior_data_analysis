##  Python — Data Cleaning & EDA

Performed data preprocessing and exploratory analysis using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

### Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

- Filled missing `review_rating` values using category-wise median
- Standardized column names into snake_case format
- Renamed inconsistent column names
- Removed redundant columns
- Created `age_group` segmentation using quartile binning
- Converted purchase frequency categories into numeric purchase-day values

### Customer Segments Created

| Segment | Description |
|---|---|
| Young Adult | Lowest age quartile |
| Adult | Second quartile |
| Middle Aged | Third quartile |
| Senior | Highest age quartile |
